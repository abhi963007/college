### Semester Breakdown

#### 1st Semester

- **ADS-main**: Advanced Data Structures lab programs divided into three lab cycles:
  - `LabCycle1`: Includes basic programs such as linked lists and basic tree traversals.
  - `LabCycle2`: Covers more complex structures like balanced trees and queues.
  - `LabCycle3`: Focuses on advanced topics like binomial heaps and graph traversal.

- **python-main**: Python programming lab, divided into five lab cycles with various topics:
  - `LabCycle1`: Introductory Python programs.
  - `LabCycle2` to `LabCycle5`: Covers topics like shapes, data processing, and advanced Python exercises.

- **web-main**: Web programming lab, organized by lab cycles, with HTML files for different projects:
  - `LabCycle1` to `LabCycle4`: Various HTML projects with topics ranging from basic page creation to interactive elements.

#### 2nd Semester

## Getting Started

Each semester folder contains subdirectories for individual lab sessions or topics. To navigate the repository:

1. Open the specific semester folder.
2. Select the subject folder (e.g., `DBMS-LAB-main` or `web-main`).
3. Inside each subject folder, you’ll find further categorized folders representing lab cycles or topics.

### Prerequisites

- **Python** for `python-main` and `data science lab`.
- **Java** for `java` programs.
- **Android Studio** for `Android lab`.
- **MySQL/MongoDB** for database labs in `DBMS-LAB-main`.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the folder of the subject or lab cycle you are interested in.
2. Open the relevant files (e.g., `.c`, `.java`, `.py`, `.sql`) to review the code and documentation.
3. Run programs in their respective environments (e.g., Python for `.py` files, Java for `.java` files).
